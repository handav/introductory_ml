## Implement Decision Trees in Python with Scikit-learn

Weâ€™ll learn about decision trees, also known as CART (classification and regression trees), and use them to explore a dataset of breast cancer tumors. 

We'll also see how to visualize a decision tree using graphviz.

If you want to visualize your decision tree, install graphviz:

brew install graphviz (mac) 

or 

apt-get install graphviz (linux, windows)

Decision trees are often used in ensembles called random forests.
