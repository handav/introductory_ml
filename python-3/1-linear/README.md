## Use Linear Regression To Estimate Continuous Values (Regression) with Python and Scikit-learn

Linear regression is a linear model that is used for regression problems, or problems where the goal is to predict a value on a continuous spectrum (as opposed to a discrete category).

We’ll use linear regression to estimate continuous values. In this case, we’ll predict house prices in Boston. We'll also look at how to visualize our results with matplotlib, and how to evaluate our models with different metrics for regression problems.

More information about r-squared (the coefficient of determination) and the mean squared error can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html.
